a method that returns the sum of two integers

  informal
    - given two integers
    - return the sum of the two integers

a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those
strings concatenated together
---
  informal
    - given an array of strings
    - iterate through the strings, adding each to an output variable
    - return the output variable
  
  
  formal
    START
    
    # Given an array of strings called strings
    
    SET iterator = 1
    SET output = ''
    
    WHILE iterator < length of strings
      SET output to output concatonated with the value at location iterator in strings
      iterator = iterator + 1
    
    PRINT output

a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every
other element from the original array, starting with the first element.
---
  informal
    - given an array of integers
    - iterate through the array, adding each other value to an output array
    - return the output array

    SET iterator = 0

    WHILE iterator < number of elements in integers

        output = output + the value at place iterator in integers
        
      iterator = iterator + 1
      
    PRINT output
  
  
a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in
a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is
'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given
character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

  informal
    - given a string
    - set the output to nil
    - iterate through the characters in the string
    - while iterating, each time we find the character, increase an iterating variable by one
    - while if the variable is three, set the output to that location
    - return the output
  
  formal
    START
    
    # Given a string and a character
    
    SET iterator = 0
    SET target_character = 0
    SET output = nil
    
    WHILE iterator < the number of characters in string
      IF the value at space iterator in the characters of string == character
        target_character = target_character + 1
      IF target_character == 3
        output = iterator

    PRINT output
  
  
a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the
arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even
indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should
become the elements at the odd indexes.
---
  informal
  - given two equally sized arrays
  - begin iterating through the first array
  - add the value at the iterator location from the first array to the output,
    then add the value at the same location from the second array to the output
  - return the output
  
  formal
  START
  
  # Given two equally sized arrays, array1 and array2
  
  SET iterator = 0
  SET output = []
  
  WHILE iterator < array1's length
    output = output + the value at iterator's value in array1 + the value at
             iterator's value in array2
